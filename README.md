# Zeta

A tool for improving at zetamac and tracking how you improve.

Recent changes:
* You don't have to press enter!
* Summary screen when it finishes
* Went back to 2 minute rounds instead of 30 minutes
* This logs your history into ~/.zeta/

I run this on Mac OS, and the input logic might encounter issues on other 
operating systems. Feel free to do whatever you want to it though.
